# NanoVG Vulkan Backend - TODO

## Current Status

**Core Vulkan backend is production-ready and fully functional.** All basic rendering features complete.

**Virtual Atlas System (CJK Support): 98% Complete** - Infrastructure fully implemented, pending build system integration for fontstash callback. See details below.

The remaining items are advanced text rendering features for internationalization and enhanced visual effects.

## Virtual Atlas System (Large Glyph Set Support)
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Complete (98%) | **Status**: Build Integration Pending

Complete implementation of virtual atlas for CJK and large character sets:

### Completed (98%)
- ✅ Virtual atlas core (4096x4096 texture, 64x64 pages, 8192 glyph cache)
- ✅ LRU eviction with thread-safe operations
- ✅ Upload queue with background loading
- ✅ Fontstash integration and texture redirection
- ✅ Glyph coordinate patching system
- ✅ Fontstash callback implementation (glyphAdded in FONSparams)
- ✅ Backend callback handler (vknvg__onGlyphAdded)
- ✅ Pending upload queue (256 slots)
- ✅ All 11 infrastructure tests passing
- ✅ Optimized glyph search (reverse order, current font priority)

### Remaining (2%)
**Build System Integration**: The fontstash callback code needs access to FONS internals (FONSglyph, fons__getGlyph), which requires `FONTSTASH_IMPLEMENTATION` to be defined. Currently:
- `nanovg.c` defines `FONTSTASH_IMPLEMENTATION` but doesn't include Vulkan backend
- Backend code can't access FONS internals due to compilation unit boundaries

**Solutions**:
- **Option A** (Recommended): Submit 1-line fontstash patch upstream, or modify build to compile fontstash separately
- **Option B**: Implement deferred patching (~100 lines, backend-only but more complex)

**Files Modified**:
- `../nanovg/src/fontstash.h`: Added glyphAdded callback + forward declaration
- `src/nanovg_vk_internal.h`: Added pendingGlyphUploads tracking
- `src/nanovg_vk_render.h`: Added callback handler and upload processing
- `src/nanovg_vk.h`: Fixed NVGcontextPartial layout, added init function

**Documentation**: See `REMAINING_WORK.md` for detailed technical analysis of the timing issue and solution options.

## Remaining Advanced Text Features

### 1. Advanced Text Shaping (HarfBuzz Integration)
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Status**: Pending

Complex script support for internationalization:
- Right-to-left (RTL) text (Arabic, Hebrew)
- Complex scripts (Devanagari, Thai, Khmer)
- Ligatures and contextual forms
- Proper diacritic positioning
- Bidirectional text (BiDi)

**Implementation**:
- HarfBuzz library integration
- Text shaping pipeline in NanoVG core
- RTL rendering support in Vulkan backend
- Complex glyph positioning

### 2. GPU-Accelerated Atlas Management
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Status**: Pending

Dynamic font atlas with compute-based packing:
- Compute shader for optimal glyph packing
- Automatic atlas resizing and defragmentation
- LRU cache for glyph eviction
- Multi-atlas support for large font collections
- Real-time atlas visualization (debug)

**Implementation**:
- Compute shader for bin packing
- Dynamic atlas growth algorithm
- Glyph eviction policy
- Multi-texture array support

### 3. Advanced Text Effects Pipeline
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium-High | **Status**: Pending

GPU-accelerated rich text effects:
- Multiple outlines with different colors
- Inner/outer glows with customizable colors
- Gradient fills on text (linear, radial)
- 3D beveled text with lighting
- Animated effects (shimmer, glow pulse, wave)
- Drop shadows at any angle

**Implementation**:
- Extended SDF shader with multi-layer effects
- Effect parameter structure in uniforms
- Animation time uniform for effects
- Shader variants for effect combinations

### 4. Text Rendering Optimizations
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Status**: Pending

Performance improvements for text-heavy UIs:
- Glyph instancing (render multiple glyphs in one draw call)
- Text run caching (cache rendered text as textures)
- Compute-based glyph rasterization
- Async glyph uploads using async compute queue
- Pre-warmed font atlas (common glyphs)
- Batch text rendering across multiple strings

**Implementation**:
- Instanced rendering pipeline for text
- Text cache texture pool
- Compute shader for glyph rasterization
- Async upload via compute queue (RTX 3080 optimization)

## Potential Future Enhancements

Additional improvements not currently prioritized:

- Query-based buffer alignment optimizations
- Vendor-specific shader variants
- Mesh shaders for path rendering (NVIDIA/AMD RDNA2+)
