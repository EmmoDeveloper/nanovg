# NanoVG to Vulkan Port - Project Overview

## ðŸ”§ Core Challenges in Porting NanoVG to Vulkan

### State Management
OpenGL handles a lot of state implicitly, while Vulkan requires you to manage everything explicitlyâ€”pipelines, descriptor sets, command buffers, etc.

### Immediate vs Retained Mode
NanoVG is designed as an immediate-mode renderer, but Vulkan is optimized for retained-mode rendering. You'll need to carefully manage draw calls and buffer updates to avoid performance pitfalls.

### Shaders and Pipelines
You'll need to rewrite NanoVG's GLSL shaders in SPIR-V or use a GLSL-to-SPIR-V compiler. Also, Vulkan requires precompiled pipelines, so you'll need to create and cache them efficiently.

### Memory Management
Vulkan gives you full control over memory allocation, which is powerful but complex. You'll need to manage vertex buffers, uniform buffers, and texture memory manually.

### Synchronization
Vulkan requires explicit synchronization (semaphores, fences, barriers). This is critical for correctness and performance, especially if you're doing dynamic buffer updates.

## ðŸ§° Helpful Tools and Libraries

- **Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)**: Simplifies Vulkan memory management.
- **SPIRV-Cross**: Helps convert SPIR-V back to readable GLSL/HLSL for debugging.
- **GLFW**: If you're using NanoVG with GLFW, it has Vulkan support built-in.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

1. Start by replicating NanoVG's basic primitives (lines, fills, gradients) using Vulkan.
2. Use validation layers extensively to catch errors early.
3. Profile performanceâ€”Vulkan can be faster, but only if used correctly.

## Current Work

If you'd like, I can help you sketch out a plan for the Vulkan backend, or walk through a specific part of the port (like how to handle stencil-based path rendering or font atlas uploads). What part are you working on right now?
